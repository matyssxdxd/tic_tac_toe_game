#Tic Tac Toe Game
A project created during JetBrains Python for Beginners course.
The game is pretty straight forward, game prints empty 3x3 table, you start as an "X" and type in the coordinates of where you want to place it, after the game prints the same 3x3 table but with an "X" on it, then it's for O's move and so on.
